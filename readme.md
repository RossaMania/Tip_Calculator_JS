# Tip Calculator

This is a tip calculator I made because I'm always worried about over/under tipping.

- No more getting flustered with math.
- No more wondering how to rank quality of service in relation to tip.
- No more accidentally tipping 25% when you meant to tip 20%. Or even worse, tipping 15% or 20% when you really meant to try to tip 25%.
- No more embarassment.

This tip calculator is based on quality of service. You input the amount of the bill, then rank the service on a scale from 1 to 10. After that just click the Calculate Total button, and the bill, tip, and total amount will be displayed.
